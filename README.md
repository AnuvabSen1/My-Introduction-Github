### My_Introduction-Github
### Hi I'm Anuvab Sen. I am a 1st Year undergrad at IIEST Shibpur. My life is built around principles( Sounds aristrocatic? Serious? ), which I refactor with every new experience in the world. Being in Electronics Engineering Dept has taught me how to manage tough schedules( Academics ) with things that also matter ( Competitive Programming, Building Stuff, My StartUp Ideas ). Using my principled approach, My target is to manage and achieve decent Coding Skill despite the hellish schedule of Department. I strongly believe that Reality is Negotiable and that one needs to be Bold to change the general perception.
### Thank You Everyone
